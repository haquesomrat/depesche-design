              <p>
                We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in
                accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the
                state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature,
                scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of
                varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of
                natural persons, in order to ensure a level of security
                appropriate to the risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the
                confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by
                controlling physical and electronic access to the data as well
                as access to, input, transmission, securing and separation of
                the data. In addition, we have established procedures to ensure
                that data subjects' rights are respected, that data is erased,
                and that we are prepared to respond to data threats rapidly.
                Furthermore, we take the protection of personal data into
                account as early as the development or selection of hardware,
                software and service providers, in accordance with the principle
                of privacy by design and privacy by default.

                <strong>TLS/SSL encryption (https):</strong> To protect the data
                of users transmitted via our online services, we use TLS/SSL
                encryption. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is the standard
                technology for securing internet connections by encrypting the
                data transmitted between a website or app and a browser (or
                between two servers). Transport Layer Security (TLS) is an
                updated and more secure version of SSL. Hyper Text Transfer
                Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is displayed in the URL when a website
                is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate.

                The legal basis under data protection law on which we process
                users' personal data with the use of cookies depends on whether
                we ask users for consent. If users consent, the legal basis for
                processing their data is their declared consent. Otherwise, the
                data processed with the help of cookies is processed on the
                basis of our legitimate interests (e.g. in a business operation
                of our online services and improvement of its usability) or, if
                this is done in the context of the fulfillment of our
                contractual obligations, if the use of cookies is necessary to
                fulfill our contractual obligations. For which purposes the
                cookies are processed by us, we do clarify in the course of this

                information required can be found in the job description or, in

                the qualifications required for a particular employment. Upon
                request, we will be happy to provide you with additional

              <p>
                If made available, applicants can submit their applications via
                an online form. The data will be transmitted to us encrypted
                according to the state of the art. Applicants can also send us
                their applications by e-mail. Please note, however, that e-mails
                on the Internet are generally not sent in encrypted form. As a
                rule, e-mails are encrypted during transport, but not on the
                servers from which they are sent and received. We can therefore
                accept no responsibility for the transmission path of the
                application between the sender and the reception on our server.
                For the purposes of searching for applicants, submitting
                applications and selecting applicants, we may make use of the

              <p>
                We send newsletters, e-mails and other electronic communications
                (hereinafter referred to as "newsletters") only with the consent
                of the recipient or a legal permission. Insofar as the contents
                of the newsletter are specifically described within the
                framework of registration, they are decisive for the consent of
                the user. Otherwise, our newsletters contain information about
                our services and us.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to subscribe to our newsletters, it is generally
                sufficient to enter your e-mail address. We may, however, ask
                you to provide a name for the purpose of contacting you
                personally in the newsletter or to provide further information
                if this is required for the purposes of the newsletter.

                <strong>Double opt-in procedure:</strong> The registration to
                our newsletter takes place in general in a so-called
                Double-Opt-In procedure. This means that you will receive an
                e-mail after registration asking you to confirm your
                registration. This confirmation is necessary so that no one can
                register with external e-mail addresses.
                <br />
                <br />
                The registrations for the newsletter are logged in order to be
                able to prove the registration process according to the legal
                requirements. This includes storing the login and confirmation
                times as well as the IP address. Likewise the changes of your
                data stored with the dispatch service provider are logged.

                may store the unsubscribed email addresses for up to three years
                based on our legitimate interests before deleting them to
                provide evidence of prior consent. The processing of these data
                is limited to the purpose of a possible defense against claims.
                An individual deletion request is possible at any time, provided
                that the former existence of a consent is confirmed at the same
                time. In the case of an obligation to permanently observe an
                objection, we reserve the right to store the e-mail address
                solely for this purpose in a blocklist.

                <br />
                The logging of the registration process takes place on the basis
                of our legitimate interests for the purpose of proving its
                proper course. If we commission a service provider to send
                e-mails, this is done on the basis of our legitimate interests
                in an efficient and secure sending system.

                    Measurement of opening rates and click rates:</strong
                  >
                  The newsletters contain a so-called "web-beacon", i.e. a
                  pixel-sized file, which is retrieved from our server when the
                  newsletter is opened or, if we use a mailing service provider,
                  from its server. Within the scope of this retrieval, technical
                  information such as information about the browser and your
                  system, as well as your IP address and time of retrieval are
                  first collected.
                  <br /><br />
                  This information is used for the technical improvement of our
                  newsletter on the basis of technical data or target groups and
                  their reading behaviour on the basis of their retrieval points
                  (which can be determined with the help of the IP address) or
                  access times. This analysis also includes determining whether
                  newsletters are opened, when they are opened and which links
                  are clicked. This information is assigned to the individual
                  newsletter recipients and stored in their profiles until the
                  profiles are deleted. The evaluations serve us much more to
                  recognize the reading habits of our users and to adapt our
                  content to them or to send different content according to the
                  interests of our users.
                  <br /><br />
                  The measurement of opening rates and click rates as well as
                  the storage of the measurement results in the profiles of the
                  users and their further processing are based on the consent of

                  unfortunately not possible, in this case the entire newsletter
                  subscription must be cancelled or objected to. In this case,
                  the stored profile information will be deleted;<br />

              <p>
                Web analysis is used to evaluate the visitor traffic on our
                website and may include the behaviour, interests or demographic
                information of users, such as age or gender, as pseudonymous
                values. With the help of web analysis we can e.g. recognize, at
                which time our online services or their functions or contents
                are most frequently used or requested for repeatedly, as well as
                which areas require optimization.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to web analysis, we can also use test procedures,
                e.g. to test and optimize different versions of our online
                services or their components.

                Unless otherwise stated below, profiles, i.e. data aggregated

                information can be stored in a browser or in a terminal device
                and read from it. The information collected includes, in
                particular, websites visited and elements used there as well as
                technical information such as the browser used, the computer
                system used and information on usage times. If users have agreed
                to the collection of their location data from us or from the
                providers of the services we use, location data may also be
                processed.

                Unless otherwise stated below, profiles, that is data summarized

                and stored in a browser or terminal device (so-called "cookies")
                or similar processes may be used for the same purpose. The
                information collected includes, in particular, websites visited
                and elements used there as well as technical information such as
                the browser used, the computer system used and information on
                usage times. If users have consented to the collection of their
                location data or profiles to us or to the providers of the

                any existing IP masking procedure (i.e. pseudonymisation by
                shortening the IP address) to protect the user. In general,
                within the framework of web analysis, A/B testing and
                optimisation, no user data (such as e-mail addresses or names)
                is stored, but pseudonyms. This means that we, as well as the
                providers of the software used, do not know the actual identity
                of the users, but only the information stored in their profiles
                for the purposes of the respective processes.

              <p>
                Within our online services, we integrate functional and content
                elements that are obtained from the servers of their respective
                providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers").
                These may, for example, be graphics, videos or city maps

              </p>
              <p>
                The integration always presupposes that the third-party
                providers of this content process the IP address of the user,
                since they could not send the content to their browser without
                the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the
                presentation of these contents or functions. We strive to use
                only those contents, whose respective offerers use the IP
                address only for the distribution of the contents. Third parties
                may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also
                known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes.
                The "pixel tags" can be used to evaluate information such as
                visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous
                information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device
                and may include technical information about the browser and
                operating system, referring websites, visit times and other
                information about the use of our website, as well as may be

              <p>
                In this section, you will find an overview of the terminology
                used in this privacy policy. Where the terminology is legally
                defined, their legal definitions apply. The following
                explanations, however, are primarily intended to aid
                understanding.

                <li>
                  <strong>Controller:</strong> "Controller" means the natural or
                  legal person, public authority, agency or other body which,
                  alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and
                  means of the processing of personal data.

                  <strong> Conversion tracking: </strong>
                  Conversion tracking is a method used to evaluate the
                  effectiveness of marketing measures. For this purpose, a
                  cookie is usually stored on the devices of the users within
                  the websites on which the marketing measures take place and
                  then called up again on the target website (e.g. we can thus
                  trace whether the advertisements placed by us on other
                  websites were successful).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Location data:</strong> Location data is created when
                  a mobile device (or another device with the technical
                  requirements for a location determination) connects to a radio
                  cell, a WLAN or similar technical means and functions of
                  location determination. Location data serve to indicate the
                  geographically determinable position of the earth at which the
                  respective device is located. Location data can be used, for
                  example, to display map functions or other information
                  dependent on a location.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Personal Data:</strong> "personal data" means any
                  information relating to an identified or identifiable natural
                  person ("data subject"); an identifiable natural person is one
                  who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular
                  by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
                  identification number, location data, an online identifier or
                  to one or more factors specific to the physical,
                  physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social
                  identity of that natural person.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Processing:</strong> The term "processing" covers a
                  wide range and practically every handling of data, be it
                  collection, evaluation, storage, transmission or erasure.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> Profiles with user-related information:</strong> The
                  processing of "profiles with user-related information", or
                  "profiles" for short, includes any kind of automated
                  processing of personal data that consists of using these
                  personal data to analyse, evaluate or predict certain personal
                  aspects relating to a natural person (depending on the type of
                  profiling, this may include different information concerning
                  demographics, behaviour and interests, such as interaction
                  with websites and their content, etc.) (e.g. interests in
                  certain content or products, click behaviour on a website or
                  location). Cookies and web beacons are often used for
                  profiling purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Web Analytics:</strong> Web Analytics serves the
                  evaluation of visitor traffic of online services and can
                  determine their behavior or interests in certain information,
                  such as content of websites. With the help of web analytics,
                  website owners, for example, can recognize at what time
                  visitors visit their website and what content they are
                  interested in. This enables them, for example, to better adapt
                  the content of their websites to the needs of their visitors.
                  For the purposes of web analytics , pseudonymous cookies and
                  web beacons are often used to recognize returning visitors and
                  thus obtain more precise analyses of the use of an online
                  service.
